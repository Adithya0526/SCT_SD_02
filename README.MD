# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple interactive application built using Python and the Tkinter library. In this game, the user is prompted to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low and tracks the number of attempts. The game is designed to be user-friendly with keyboard and mouse input support, full-screen mode, and a colorful interface.

## Code Explanation
### Key Components
1. **Random Number Generation**:
   - A random number between 1 and 100 is generated using Python's `random` module.
     ```python
     random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
     ```
2. **Event Handling**:
   - Mouse clicks are handled via the `command` parameter of buttons.
   - Keyboard input (Enter key) is handled using `bind`:
     ```python
     guess_entry.bind("<Return>", check_guess)
     ```
3. **Feedback**:
   - The program provides immediate feedback based on the guess:
     ```python
     if user_guess < random_number:
         result_label.config(text="Too low! Try again.")
     elif user_guess > random_number:
         result_label.config(text="Too high! Try again.")
     else:
         result_label.config(text="Congratulations! You guessed it!")
     ```
4. **UI Design**:
   - Full-screen mode:
     ```python
     root.attributes("-fullscreen", True)
     ```
   - Color scheme and fonts for a user-friendly interface.
